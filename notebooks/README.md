# DNA Sequence Analysis

## Overview

A simple Python project for analyzing DNA sequences using Pandas. The program calculates nucleotide counts, nucleotide frequencies, and GC content from a DNA sequence.

This project demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts and basic bioinformatics analysis.

## Features

- **Sequence Length:** Calculate the total number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence.
- **Nucleotide Counts:** Count the occurrences of adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).
- **Nucleotide Frequencies:** Calculate the percentage of each nucleotide in the sequence.
- **GC Content:** Calculate the percentage of guanine and cytosine nucleotides.
- **Data Analysis:** Organize and analyze nucleotide counts using Pandas DataFrames.

## Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas

## Example Analysis

The program takes a DNA sequence as input:

```python
dna_sequence = "ATCGATCGATCGCGTAGCTAGCCTAGCTAGCTAGCTACTATCGCGATATATCTACTATATAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTACTACTG"
```

Nucleotide counts are calculated and organized into a Pandas DataFrame.

GC content is calculated using:

**GC Content (%) = (G + C) / Total Nucleotides × 100**

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.

## Learning Objectives

This project explores several foundational Python concepts:

- String manipulation and nucleotide counting
- Lists and list comprehensions
- Pandas DataFrames
- Boolean indexing with `.loc` and `.isin()`
- Basic statistical calculations
- Formatting numerical output

## Future Improvements

Potential extensions include:

- Reading DNA sequences from FASTA files
- Supporting multiple sequences
- Calculating reverse complements
- Identifying open reading frames (ORFs)
- Visualizing nucleotide composition
- Comparing GC content across sequences

## Purpose

This project was developed as a hands-on exercise to strengthen Python programming and data analysis skills through practical bioinformatics applications.
